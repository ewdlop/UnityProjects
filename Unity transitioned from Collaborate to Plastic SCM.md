# Unity transitioned from Collaborate to Plastic SCM

Before Unity transitioned from Collaborate to Plastic SCM, users reported several challenges with the Collaborate service:

- **Reliability Issues**: Collaborate was described as "buggy," often failing in critical tasks, which hindered the game development process. citeturn0search9

- **Migration Difficulties**: The process of migrating projects from Collaborate to Plastic SCM was complex, especially for users without prior experience with Plastic SCM. citeturn0search9

- **Project Compatibility**: Some users experienced project breakages after transitioning to Plastic SCM, despite having no prior issues with Collaborate. citeturn0search2

- **Incomplete Migrations**: There were instances where projects were not automatically migrated to Plastic SCM, leading to concerns about data loss and lack of prior notification. citeturn0search7

These challenges highlighted the need for a more robust and user-friendly version control system, which led to the adoption of Plastic SCM.
