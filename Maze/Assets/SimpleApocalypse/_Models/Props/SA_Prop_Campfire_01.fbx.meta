// Utility functions for GTMTestExposedBindings Macro. Don't use it directly
// but use the macro below instead
BOOL GTMDoExposedBindingsFunctionCorrectly(NSObject *object, 
                                           NSArray **errors);

// Tests the setters and getters for exposed bindings
// For objects that expose bindings, this tests them for you, saving you from
// having to write a whole pile of set/get test code if you add binding support.
// You will need to implement valueClassForBinding: for your bindings,
// and you may possibly want to implement unitTestExposedBindingsToIgnore
// and unitTestExposedBindingsTestValues. See descriptions of those
// methods below for details.
//  Implemented as a macro to match the rest of the SenTest macros.
//
//  Args:
//    a1: The object to be checked.
//    description: A format string as in the printf() function.
