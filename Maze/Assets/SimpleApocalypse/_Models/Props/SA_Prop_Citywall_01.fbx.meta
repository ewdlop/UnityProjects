The Macintosh build requires Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8.3 (or higher).
The Windows build requires Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (or higher).

1) install the Photoshop SDK

These projects expect that you have checked the "Photoshop" 
module out to the same root directory that contains the other
OpenEXR modules, and that you have added a directory called 
"sdk" to the Photoshop module that contains the Adobe Photoshop
SDK.  Your source tree should look like this:

|- MacCodeWarrior
|- OpenEXR
|- Photoshop
      |- doc
      |- mac
      |- rsrc
      |- sdk
      |   |- PhotoshopAPI
      |   |- PhotoshopUtils
      |   |- resources
      |- src
      |- win32
|- zlib

Note that this distribution does not include the Photoshop SDK because of
licensing issues.  You must be a registered Adobe developer to obtain this
SDK.  Visit www.adobe.com to learn more.

The "Photoshop/sdk/resources" folder can be found here:

{Photoshop SDK}/samplecode/resources

This contains the tools necessary to create the PiPL resources on the Windows platform. 
If you're unfamiliar with PiPLs, there is some excellent documentation available
in the Photoshop SDK.

Note that if you're only interested in building the Windows version of this plug-in,
you don't need to check out the "MacCodeWarrior" module from the OpenEXR repository.
