    /*=================================JapaneseCalendar==========================
    **
    ** JapaneseCalendar is based on Gregorian calendar.  The month and day values are the same as
    ** Gregorian calendar.  However, the year value is an offset to the Gregorian
    ** year based on the era.
    **
    ** This system is adopted by Emperor Meiji in 1868. The year value is counted based on the reign of an emperor,
    ** and the era begins on the day an emperor ascends the throne and continues until his death or his abdication.
    ** The era changes at 12:00AM.
    **
    ** For example, the current era is Reiwa.  It started on 2019/5/1 A.D.  Therefore, Gregorian year 2019 is also Reiwa 1st.
    ** 2019/5/1 A.D. is also Reiwa 1st 5/1.
    **
    ** Any date in the year during which era is changed can be reckoned in either era.  For example,
    ** 2019/1/1 can be 1/1 Reiwa 1st year or 1/1 Heisei 31st year.
    **
    ** Note:
    **  The DateTime can be represented by the JapaneseCalendar are limited to two factors:
    **      1. The min value and max value of DateTime class.
    **      2. The available era information.
    **
    **  Calendar support range:
    **      Calendar    Minimum     Maximum
