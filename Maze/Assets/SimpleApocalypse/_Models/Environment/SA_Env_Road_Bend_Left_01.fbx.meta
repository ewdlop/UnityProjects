-- Testcases for functions in cmath.
--
-- Each line takes the form:
--
-- <testid> <function> <input_value> -> <output_value> <flags>
--
-- where:
--
--   <testid> is a short name identifying the test,
--
--   <function> is the function to be tested (exp, cos, asinh, ...),
--
--   <input_value> is a pair of floats separated by whitespace
--     representing real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and
--
--   <output_value> is the expected (ideal) output value, again
--     represented as a pair of floats.
--
--   <flags> is a list of the floating-point flags required by C99
--
-- The possible flags are:
--
--   divide-by-zero : raised when a finite input gives a
--     mathematically infinite result.
--
--   overflow : raised when a finite input gives a finite result whose
--     real or imaginary part is too large to fit in the usual range
--     of an IEEE 754 double.
--
--   invalid : raised for invalid inputs.
--
--   ignore-real-sign : indicates that the sign of the real part of
--     the result is unspecified; if the real part of the result is
--     given as inf, then both -inf and inf should be accepted as
--     correct.
--
--   ignore-imag-sign : indicates that the sign of the imaginary part
--     of the result is unspecified.
--
-- Flags may appear in any order.
--
-- Lines beginning with '--' (like this one) start a comment, and are
-- ignored.  Blank lines, or lines containing only whitespace, are also
-- ignored.

-- The majority of the values below were computed with the help of
-- version 2.3 of the MPFR library for multiple-precision
