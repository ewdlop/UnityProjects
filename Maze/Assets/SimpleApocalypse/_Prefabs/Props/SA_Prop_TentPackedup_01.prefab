# The DOCSET_PUBLISHER_ID tag specifies a string that should uniquely identify
# the documentation publisher. This should be a reverse domain-name style
# string, e.g. com.mycompany.MyDocSet.documentation.
# The default value is: org.doxygen.Publisher.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_DOCSET is set to YES.

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES then doxygen generates three
# additional HTML index files: index.hhp, index.hhc, and index.hhk. The
# index.hhp is a project file that can be read by Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop
# (see: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138) on
# Windows.
#
# The HTML Help Workshop contains a compiler that can convert all HTML output
# generated by doxygen into a single compiled HTML file (.chm). Compiled HTML
# files are now used as the Windows 98 help format, and will replace the old
# Windows help format (.hlp) on all Windows platforms in the future. Compressed
# HTML files also contain an index, a table of contents, and you can search for
# words in the documentation. The HTML workshop also contains a viewer for
# compressed HTML files.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# The CHM_FILE tag can be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm
# file. You can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be
# written to the html output directory.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTMLHELP is set to YES.

# The HHC_LOCATION tag can be used to specify the location (absolute path
# including file name) of the HTML help compiler (hhc.exe). If non-empty,
# doxygen will try to run the HTML help compiler on the generated index.hhp.
# The file has to be specified with full path.
