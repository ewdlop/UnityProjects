"""A bottom-up tree matching algorithm implementation meant to speed
up 2to3's matching process. After the tree patterns are reduced to
their rarest linear path, a linear Aho-Corasick automaton is
created. The linear automaton traverses the linear paths from the
leaves to the root of the AST and returns a set of nodes for further
matching. This reduces significantly the number of candidate nodes."""
