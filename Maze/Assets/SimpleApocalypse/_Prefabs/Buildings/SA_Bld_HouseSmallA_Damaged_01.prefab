.TH Mono "MozRoots"
.SH NAME
mozroots \- Download and import trusted root certificates from Mozilla's LXR into Mono's certificate store
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B mozroots [--import [--machine] [--sync | --ask | --ask-add | --ask-remove]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program downloads the trusted root certificates from the Mozilla
LXR web site into the Mono certificate store.  
.PP
Mono by default does not ship with any default certificates and allows
the user to pick its trusted certificates.  The mozroots command will
bring the Mozilla certificates into your local machine. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "--import"
Import the certificates into the trust store.
.TP
.I "--sync"
Synchronize (add/remove) the trust store with the certificates.
Synchronize is useful for new Mono installations (no roots) and for
automated updates (no user confirmation for addition or removal).
.TP
.I "--ask"
Always confirm before adding or removing trusted certificates.
.B Note:
The initial import will likely add about 100 new trusted root
certificates into your store. You'll have to answer
.B yes
to every one of them if this option is specified.
.TP
.I "--ask-add"
Always confirm before adding a new trusted certificate.
.B Note:
The initial import will likely add about 100 new trusted root
certificates into your store. You'll have to answer
.B yes
to every one of them if this option is specified.
.TP
.I "--ask-remove"
Always confirm before removing an existing trusted certificate.
.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS
.TP
.I "--url url"
Specify an alternative URL for downloading the trusted certificates
(LXR source format). This should only be useful for testing or if 
the Mozilla's LXR web site address is changed. It can also be used
to cache a local copy of the LXR file into your local intranet.
.TP
.I "--file name"
Do not download from LXR but use the specified file. This is useful
if many computers have to download the same file from the Internet.
This way you can keep a local copy on a file server (and minimize
network traffic).
.TP
.I "--pkcs7 name"
Export the certificates into a PKCS#7 file. This is useful for 
debugging purpose or for re-importing the same list into other 
software.
.TP
.I "--machine"
Import the certificate in the machine trust store. The default is to
import all trusted root certificates into the current user store.
.TP
.I "--quiet"
Limit console output to errors and confirmations messages. This is
useful when scripting.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
After the initial Mono installation you'll have no trusted roots 
certificates pre-installed. 
Neither will you have some root test certificates installed (your own
or the ones provided by using 
.B setreg
). In this case the simplest thing to do, if you want to trust all 
those certificates, is to import and synchronize.

.PP
If you created some test certificates (e.g. for using SSL/TLS with XSP)
and/or if your enterprise requires some additional root certificates
(e.g. intranet) then you may want to skip the removal part of the 
process. You can do this by asking for a removal confirmation 
(--ask-remove option) and answer no when prompted.
