// Find the convex hull of a point set in the plane

// An implementation of Graham's (1972) point elimination algorithm,
// as modified by Andrew (1979) to find lower and upper hull separately.

// This implementation correctly handle duplicate points, and
// multiple points with the same x-coordinate.

// 1. Sort the points lexicographically by increasing (x,y), thus 
//    finding also a leftmost point L and a rightmost
