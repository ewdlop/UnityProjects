version: 2.59

-- This set of tests tests the extended specification 'round-to-integral
-- value-exact' operations (from IEEE 854, later modified in 754r).
-- All non-zero results are defined as being those from either copy or
-- quantize, so those are assumed to have been tested extensively
-- elsewhere; the tests here are for integrity, rounding mode, etc.
-- Also, it is assumed the test harness will use these tests for both
-- ToIntegralExact (which does set Inexact) and the fixed-name
-- functions (which do not set Inexact).

-- Note that decNumber implements an earlier definition of toIntegral
-- which never sets Inexact; the decTest operator for that is called
-- 'tointegral' instead of 'tointegralx'.
