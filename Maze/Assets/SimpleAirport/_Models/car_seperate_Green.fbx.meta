iceHost and the Dispatcher</a></format>.</para>
      <para>Once a customization has been decided upon (and the customization interface implemented if necessary) and the <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior" /> is the appropriate scope of customization, the customization must be inserted into the indigo1 runtime by implementing <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior" /> and adding the operation behavior to the runtime.</para>
      <para>There are two ways to add the <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior" /> to the runtime:</para>
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>
          <para>Programmatically add the custom operation behavior to the <see cref="P:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors" /> property prior to the opening of the service host (in a service application) or the channel factory (in a client application).</para>
        </item>
        <item>
          <para>Add the behavior using a custom attribute. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>To perform the service customization task for which it is intended, the <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior" /> object must be added to the <see cref="P:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors" /> property prior to the construction of the service runtime, which occurs when <see cref="Overload:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open" /> method is called on <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost" />. To perform a client customization task, the <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior" /> object must be added to the <see cref="P:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors" /> property before calling the <see cref="Overload:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory`1.CreateChannel" /> method or the <see cref="Overload:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open" /> method on <see cref="T:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory`1" />. </para>
      <para>Although the operation behavior is designed for easy access to the runtime at the scope of an individual operation, you can access the runtime at a larger scope by accessing the parent runtime object.</para>
