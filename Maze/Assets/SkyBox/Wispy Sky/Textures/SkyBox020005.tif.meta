     * Returns the longest match for s in text at the given position.
     * If limit > start then match forward from start+1 to limit
     * matching all characters except s.charAt(0).  If limit < start,
     * go backward starting from start-1 matching all characters
     * except s.charAt(s.length()-1).  This method assumes that the
     * first character, text.charAt(start), matches s, so it does not
     * check it.
     * @param text the text to match
     * @param start the first character to match.  In the forward
     * direction, text.charAt(start) is matched against s.charAt(0).
     * In the reverse direction, it is matched against
     * s.charAt(s.length()-1).
     * @param limit the limit offset for matching, either last+1 in
     * the forward direction, or last-1 in the reverse direction,
     * where last is the index of the last character to match.
     * @param s
     * @return If part of s matches up
