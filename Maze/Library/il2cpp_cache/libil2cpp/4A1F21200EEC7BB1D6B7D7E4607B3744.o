 * By default, DSO_load() will translate the provided filename into a form
 * typical for the platform (more specifically the DSO_METHOD) using the
 * dso_name_converter function of the method. Eg. win32 will transform "blah"
 * into "blah.dll", and dlfcn will transform it into "libblah.so". The
 * behaviour can be overriden by setting the name_converter callback in the
 * DSO object (using DSO_set_name_converter()). This callback could even
 * utilise the DSO_METHOD's converter too if it only wants to override
 * behaviour for one or two possible DSO methods. However, the following flag
 * can be set in a DSO to prevent *any* native name-translation at all - eg.
 * if the caller has prompted the user for a path to a driver library so the
 * filename should be interpreted as-is.
