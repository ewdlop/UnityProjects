/**
 * Declares an API to be included in this API. The including API must
 * redeclare all the methods from the included API, but documentation
 * and options are inherited as follows:
 *
 * - If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation
 *   string of the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited
 *   from the original method.
 *
 * - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
 *   visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
 *   inherited.
 *
 * - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
 *   modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
 *   version of the including API plus the [root][] path if specified.
 *
 * Example of a simple mixin:
 *
 *     package google.acl.v1;
 *     service AccessControl {
 *       // Get the underlying ACL object.
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     package google.storage.v2;
 *     service Storage {
 *       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);
 *
 *       // Get a data record.
 *       rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
 *         option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
 *       }
 *     }
