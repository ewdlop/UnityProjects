	This document describes how to embed the Mono runtime in your
	application, and how to invoke CIL methods from C, and how to
	invoke C code from CIL. Both the JIT and interpreter can be
	embedded in very similar ways so most of what is described
	here can be used in either case.

* Embedding the runtime.

	Embedding the runtime consists of various steps: 

		* Compiling and linking the Mono runtime

		* Initializing the Mono runtime

		* Optionally expose C code to the C#/CIL universe.

	These are discussed in detail next.

** Compiling and Linking

	To embed the runtime, you have to link your code against the
	Mono runtime libraries.  To do this, you want to pass the
	flags returned by pkg-config to your compiler:

		pkg-config --cflags --libs mono

	is used to get the flags for the JIT runtime and

		pkg-config --cflags --libs mint

	for the interpreted r
