*   The current code in this file replaces the previous implementation
*   of conversion code from multi-byte codepages to Unicode and back.
*   This implementation supports the following:
*   - legacy variable-length codepages with up to 4 bytes per character
*   - all Unicode code points (up to 0x10ffff)
*   - efficient distinction of unassigned vs. illegal byte sequences
*   - it is possible in fromUnicode() to directly deal with simple
*     stateful encodings (used for EBCDIC_STATEFUL)
*   - it is possible to convert Unicode code points
*     to a single zero byte (but not as a fallback except for SBCS)
*
*   Remaining limitations in fromUnicode:
*   - byte sequences must not have leading zero bytes
*   - except for SBCS codepages: no fallback mapping from Unicode to a zero byte
*   - limitation to up to 4 bytes per character
*
*   ICU 2.8 (late 2003) adds a secondary data structure which lifts some of these
*   limitations and adds m:n character mappings and other features.
*   See ucnv_ext.h for details.
