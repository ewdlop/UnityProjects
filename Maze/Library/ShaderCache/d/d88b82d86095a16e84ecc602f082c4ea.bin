its, regardless of whether they all actually _use_ the same number
 * of code units. This is necessary for simple array access.
 *
 * An additional feature comes in with what in ICU is called "fallback"
 * mappings:
 *
 * In addition to round-trippable, precise, 1:1 mappings, there are often
 * mappings defined between similar, though not the same, characters.
 * Typically, such mappings occur only in fromUnicode mapping tables because
 * Unicode has a superset repertoire of most other codepages. However, it
 * is possible to provide such mappings in the toUnicode tables, too.
 * In this case, the fallback mappings are partly integrated into the
 * general state tables because the structure of the encoding includes their
 * byte sequences.
 * For final entries in an initial state, fallback mappings are stored in
 * the entry itself like with roundtrip mappings.
 * For other final entries, they are stored in the code units table if
 * the entry is for a pair of code units.
 * For single-unit results in the code units table, there is no space to
 * alternatively hold a fallback mapping; in this case, the code unit
 * is stored as U+fffe (unassigned), and the fallback mapping needs to
 * be looked up by the scalar offset value in a separate table.
 *
 * "Unassigned" state entries really mean "structurally unassigned",
 * i.e., such a byte sequence will never have a mapping result.
 *
 * The interpretation of the bits in each entry is as follows:
 *
 * Bit 31 not set, not a terminal entry ("transitional"):
