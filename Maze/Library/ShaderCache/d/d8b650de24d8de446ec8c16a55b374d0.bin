 *
 *   The entire fromUBytes array is omitted from the file and will be reconstitued.
 *   This is done by enumerating all toUnicode roundtrip mappings, performing
 *   each mapping (using the stage 1 and reconstituted stage 2 tables) and
 *   writing instead of reading the byte values.

 * _MBCSHeader version 4.3
 *
 * Change from version 4.2:
 * - Optional utf8Friendly data structures, with 64-entry stage 3 block
 *   allocation for parts of the BMP, and an additional mbcsIndex in non-SBCS
 *   files which can be used instead of stages 1 & 2.
 *   Faster lookups for roundtrips from most commonly used characters,
 *   and lookups from UTF-8 byte sequences with a natural bit distribution.
 *   See ucnvmbcs.h for more details.
 *
 * Change from version 4.1:
 * - Added an optional extension table structure at the end of the .cnv file.
 *   It is present if the upper bits of the header flags field contains a non-zero
 *   byte offset to it.
 *   Files that contain only a conversion table and no base table
 *   use the special outputType MBCS_OUTPUT_EXT_ONLY.
 *   These contain the base table name between the MBC
