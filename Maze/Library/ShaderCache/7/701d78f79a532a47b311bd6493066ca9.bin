tried it. In addition, many consider using Python a pleasure -- a better
recommendation is hard to imagine.

I am solely responsible for Python's strengths and shortcomings, even when some
of the code has been written by others. However, its success is the product of
a community, starting with the early adopters who picked it up when I first
published Python on the net, and who spread the word about it in their own
environment. They sent me their praise, criticism, feature requests, code
contributions, and personal revelations via email. They were willing to discuss
every aspect of Python in the mailing list that I soon set up, and educate me
or nudge me in the right direction where my initial intuition failed me. There
have been too many contributors to thank individually. I'll make one exception,
however: this book's author was one of Python's early adopters and evangelists.
