# If SOURCE_TOOLTIPS is enabled (the default) then hovering a hyperlink in the
# source code will show a tooltip with additional information such as prototype,
# brief description and links to the definition and documentation. Since this
# will make the HTML file larger and loading of large files a bit slower, you
# can opt to disable this feature.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES.

# If the USE_HTAGS tag is set to YES then the references to source code will
# point to the HTML generated by the htags(1) tool instead of doxygen built-in
# source browser. The htags tool is part of GNU's global source tagging system
# (see http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). You will need version
# 4.8.6 or higher.
#
# To use it do the following:
# - Install the latest version of global
# - Enable SOURCE_BROWSER and USE_HTAGS in the config file
# - Make sure the INPUT points to the root of the source tree
# - Run doxygen as normal
#
# Doxygen will invoke htags (and that will in turn invoke gtags), so these
# tools must be available from the command line (i.e. in the search path).
#
# The result: instead of the source browser generated by doxygen, the links to
# source code will now point to the output of htags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES.
