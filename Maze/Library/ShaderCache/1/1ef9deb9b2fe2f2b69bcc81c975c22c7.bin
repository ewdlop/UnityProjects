# generated by doxygen into a single compiled HTML file (.chm). Compiled HTML
# files are now used as the Windows 98 help format, and will replace the old
# Windows help format (.hlp) on all Windows platforms in the future. Compressed
# HTML files also contain an index, a table of contents, and you can search for
# words in the documentation. The HTML workshop also contains a viewer for
# compressed HTML files.
