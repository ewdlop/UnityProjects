# The TAGFILES tag can be used to specify one or more tag files. For each tag
# file the location of the external documentation should be added. The format of

# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ...

# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ...
# where loc1 and loc2 can be relative or absolute paths or URLs. See the
# section "Linking to external documentation" for more information about the use
# of tag files.

# the path). If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen is
# run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.
