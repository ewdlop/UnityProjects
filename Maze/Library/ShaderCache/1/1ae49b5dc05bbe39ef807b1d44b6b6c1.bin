    // This is the base object pool class which manages objects in a FIFO queue. The objects are 
    // created through the provided Func<T> createObjectFunc. The main purpose for this class is
    // to get better memory usage for Garbage Collection (GC) when part or all of an object is
    // regularly pinned. Constantly creating such objects can cause large Gen0 Heap fragmentation
    // and thus high memory usage pressure. The pooled objects are first created in Gen0 heaps and
    // would be eventually moved to a more stable segment which would prevent the fragmentation
    // to happen.
    //
    // The objects are created in batches for better localization of the objects. Here are the
    // parameters that control the behavior of creation/removal:
    // 
    // batchAllocCount: number of objects to be created at the same time when new objects are needed
    //
    // createObjectFunc: func delegate that is used to create objects by sub-classes.
    //
    // maxFreeCount: max number of free objects the queue can store. This is to make sure the memory
    //     usage is bounded.
