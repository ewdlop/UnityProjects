and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            =

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            =

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading style
# sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to fine-tune the look of
# the HTML output. If left blank doxygen will generate a default style sheet.
# See also section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the style
# sheet that doxygen normally uses.
# Note: It is recommended to use HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET instead of this tag, as
# it is more robust and this tag (HTML_STYLESHEET) will in the future become
# obsolete.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_STYLESHEET        =

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify an additional user-
# defined cascading style sheet that is included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefor more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet file to the output directory. For an example
# see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.
