# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for

# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
