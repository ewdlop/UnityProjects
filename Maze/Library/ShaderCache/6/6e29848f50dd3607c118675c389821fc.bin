// comprises the frames that were captured during the quality measurement test.
// There may be missing or duplicate frames. Also the frames start at a random
// position in the original video. We should provide a statistics file along
// with the test video. The stats file contains the connection between the
// actual frames in the test file and their bar code number. There is one file
// for the reference video and one for the test video. The stats file should
// be in the form 'frame_xxxx yyyy', where xxxx is the consecutive
// number of the frame in the test video, and yyyy is the barcode number.
// The stats file could be produced by
// tools/barcode_tools/barcode_decoder.py. This script decodes the barcodes
// integrated in every video and generates the stats file. If three was some
// problem with the decoding there would be 'Barcode error' instead of yyyy.
// The stat files are used to compare the right frames with each other and
// to calculate statistics.
