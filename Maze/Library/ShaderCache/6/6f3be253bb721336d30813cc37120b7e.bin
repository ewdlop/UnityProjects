e and conventions, without being Unix-bound. And
in fact, the first implementation was done on a Mac.

As it turned out, Python is remarkably free from many of the hang-ups of
conventional programming languages. This is perhaps due to my choice of
examples: besides ABC, my main influence was Modula-3. This is another language
with remarkable elegance and power, designed by a small, strong-willed team
(most of whom I had met during a summer internship at DEC's Systems Research
Center in Palo Alto). Imagine what Python would have looked like if I had
modelled it after the Unix shell and C instead! (Yes, I borrowed from C too,
but only its least controversial features, in my desire to please the Unix/C

Any individual creation has its ideosyncracies, and occasionally its creator
has to justify these. Perhaps Pyth
