more readable in two ways. First, the use of indentation reduces visual clutter
and makes programs shorter, thus reducing the attention span needed to take in
a basic unit of code. Second, it allows the programmer less freedom in
formatting, thereby enabling a more uniform style, which makes it easier to

conventions for the placement of braces in C, each with strong proponents.)

This emphasis on readability is no accident. As an object-oriented language,
Python aims to encourage the creation of reusable code. Even if we all wrote
perfect documentation all of the time, code can hardly be c
