I will gladly admit that Python is not the fastest running scripting language.
It is a good runner-up though. With ever-increasing hardware speed, the
accumulated running time of a program during its lifetime is often negligible
compared to the programmer time needed to write and debug it. This, of course,
is where the real savings can be made. While this is hard to assess
objectively, Python is considered a winner in coding time by most who have
tried it. In addition, many consider using Python a pleasure -- a better
recommendation is hard to imagine.

I am solely responsible for Python's strengths and shortcomings, even when some
of the code has been written by others. However, its success is the product of
a community, starting with the early adopters who picked it up when I first
published Python on the net, and who spread the word about it in their own
environment. They sent me their praise, criticism, feature requests, code
contributions, and personal revelatio
