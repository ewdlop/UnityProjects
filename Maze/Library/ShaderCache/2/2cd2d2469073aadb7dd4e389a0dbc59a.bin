%description					

			# Full description. Can be multiple lines.
The HDF5 technology suite includes:

    * A versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects and a wide variety of metadata.

    * A completely portable file format with no limit on the number or size of data objects in the collection.

    * A software library that runs on a range of computational platforms, from laptops to massively parallel systems, and implements a high-level API with C, C++, Fortran 90, and Java interfaces.

    * A rich set of integrated performance features that allow for access time and storage space optimizations.

    * Tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing the data in the collection.

The HDF5 data model, file format, API, library, and tools are open and distributed without charge.
