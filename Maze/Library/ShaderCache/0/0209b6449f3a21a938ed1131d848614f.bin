          <para>The COM+ integration configuration tool (ComSvcConfig.exe) can be used to add specific methods from a COM interface to appear on the generated service contract. </para>
          <para>For example, you can use the following command to add the three named methods from the IFinances COM interface on the ItemOrders.Financial component, to the generated service contract.</para>
          <code>ComSvcConfig.exe /i /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances.{TransferFunds,AddFunds,RemoveFunds} /hosting:complus</code>
          <para>When you run the ComSvcConfig.exe tool, it then generates the following service contract listing the previously mentioned methods as exposedMethod elements.</para>
          <code />
          <para>code reference: S_UEComContractElement#101</para>
          <para>At service initialization time, the runtime attempts to generate a service contract by reflecting over and adding only the methods included in the list of exposedMethod elements. A trace is produced for every interface method that is not included on the service contract.</para>
