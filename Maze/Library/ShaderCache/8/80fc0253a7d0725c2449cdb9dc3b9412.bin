#. Otherwise, a temporary of type ``T __autoreleasing`` is created and
   initialized to a null pointer.
#. If the parameter is not an Objective-C method parameter marked ``out``,
   then ``*p`` is read, and the result is written into the temporary with
   primitive semantics.
#. The address of the temporary is passed as the argument to the actual call.
#. After the call completes, the temporary is loaded with primitive
   semantics, and that value is assigned into ``*p``.

.. admonition:: Rationale

  This is all admittedly convoluted.  In an ideal world, we would see that a
  local variable is being passed to an out-parameter and retroactively modify
  its type to be ``__autoreleasing`` rather than ``__strong``.  This would be
  remarkably difficult and not always well-founded under the C type system.
  However, it was judged unacceptably invasive to require programmers to write
  ``__autoreleasing`` on all the variables they intend to use for
  out-parameters.  This was the least bad solution.
