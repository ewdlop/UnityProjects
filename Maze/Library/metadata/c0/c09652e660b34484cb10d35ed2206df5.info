"""Restricted execution facilities.

The class RExec exports methods r_exec(), r_eval(), r_execfile(), and
r_import(), which correspond roughly to the built-in operations
exec, eval(), execfile() and import, but executing the code in an
environment that only exposes those built-in operations that are
deemed safe.  To this end, a modest collection of 'fake' modules is
created which mimics the standard modules by the same names.  It is a
policy decision which built-in modules and operations are made
available; this module provides a reasonable default, but derived
classes can change the policies e.g. by overriding or extending class
variables like ok_builtin_module
