nt. As an object-oriented language,
Python aims to encourage the creation of reusable code. Even if we all wrote
perfect documentation all of the time, code can hardly be considered reusable
if it's not readable. Many of Python's features, in addition to its use of
indentation, conspire to make Python code highly readable. This reflects the
philosophy of ABC, which was intended to teach programming in its purest form,
and therefore placed a high value on clarity.

Readability is often enhanced by reducing unnecessary variability. When
possible, there's a single, obvious way to code a particular construct. This
reduces the number of choices facing the programmer who is writing the code,
and increases the chance that will appear familiar to a second programmer
