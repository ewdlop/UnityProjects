Oops!

Your 'rm' program seems unable to run without file operands specified
on the command line, even when the '-f' option is present.  This is contrary
to the behaviour of most rm programs out there, and not conforming with
the upcoming POSIX standard: <http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=542>

Please tell bug-automake@gnu.org about your system, including the value
of your $PATH and any error possibly output before this message.  This
can help us improve future automake versions.

Aborting the configuration process, to ensure you take notice of the issue.

You can download and install GNU coreutils to get an 'rm' implementation
that behaves properly: <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>.

If you want to complete the configuration process using your problematic
'rm' anyway, export the environment variable ACCEPT_INFERIOR_RM_PROGRAM
to "yes", and re-run configure.
