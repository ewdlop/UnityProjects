# A map from type name to type letter.  We use this map for two reasons:
#  1. We want the debugging stuff in the source code to be as unobtrusive as
#     possible, which means as compact as possible.
#  2. It's easier (faster) to parse these one and two-letter types in the C
#     functions that display debugging results.
#
# All type strings are one or two characters.  One-character strings
# are always lower case and should be used for common types.
# Two-character strings begin with an upper-case letter which is
# usually the same as the package name.
