# The macro choose_msvc_crt() takes a list of possible
# C runtimes to choose from, in the form of compiler flags,
# to present to the user. (MTd for /MTd, etc)
#
# The macro is invoked at the end of the file.
#
# CMake already sets CRT flags in the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_* and
# CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* variables by default. To let the user
# override that for each build type:
# 1. Detect which CRT is already selected, and reflect this in
# LLVM_USE_CRT_* so the user can have a better idea of what
# changes they're making.
# 2. Replace the flags in both variables with the new flag via a regex.
# 3. set() the variables back into the cache so the changes
# are user-visible.
